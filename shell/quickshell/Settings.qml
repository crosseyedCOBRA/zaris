// GUI settings app: sidebar (category list) + content pane, modeled after
// Noctalia's own settings panel (a screenshot of it was the direct
// reference) rather than the single long scrolling list this used to be.
// Each category maps to something that genuinely already has settings
// today (Bar's per-module config, Dock's enabled/mode) - no placeholder
// categories for features that don't exist yet. New categories get added
// as the underlying WM/shell feature they'd configure actually exists, not
// ahead of it - the full WM config (keybinds, window rules, gaps/borders)
// still has no GUI and stays hand-edit-only in zaris.conf for now (see
// ROADMAP.md's "GUI settings app, full WM config" backlog item, which this
// is the first step of).
//
// Phase 2 of the Noctalia-port effort (see ROADMAP.md): this is the first
// existing screen rebuilt to actually use the ported widget library rather
// than the original hand-rolled Rectangle/Text pattern - the plain
// Flickable is now NScrollView (real scrollbar styling + smooth wheel
// scroll), raw Text is now NText throughout (consistent typography off
// Style.qml's tokens), and the two-Rectangle "pill pair" selectors
// (screens: All/Primary, dock mode: Reserved/Floating) are now
// NTabBar/NTabButton, a genuine behavioral and visual upgrade over the
// hand-rolled pair (proper hover states, tooltip support, shared
// segmented-control styling used the same way a future settings row would
// elsewhere). The sidebar nav list is intentionally left as its own
// pattern - it's a vertical category list, not a fit for NTabBar's
// horizontal segmented-control shape.
//
// Still writes straight through the same ModulesConfig/DockConfig
// FileViews as before - same JSON files, same live-apply behavior, just
// reorganized under a nav shell instead of one flat list.
//
// Built on PopupWindow rather than a FloatingWindow, same reasoning as
// CalendarFlyout.qml/Tooltip.qml: anchors directly to the bar's own
// full-width background surface (ControlCenterState.barItem - opened by
// clicking the gear button inside Control Center, which sets
// SettingsState.targetItem to that surface right before opening this and
// closing itself) via `anchor.item`, so it opens attached to the bar
// rather than centered on screen - needing none of Zaris's WM-side
// windowrule system, and no `title` property to match a rule against
// (PopupWindow doesn't expose one at all - positioning is entirely
// anchor-based now). Deliberately anchored to the bar surface and not the
// gear button that's actually clicked - Control Center closes at the same
// moment Settings opens, and a PopupWindow can't anchor to a target
// inside a window that's just gone invisible; the bar itself never
// closes, so it stays a valid anchor regardless of Control Center's state.
// Anchoring to the full-width surface (rather than the launcher icon
// itself, as an earlier pass did) also means the centering math below is
// centering under the whole bar, not just under a small icon near its edge.

    // Safety net for PopupWindow's own `onClosed` (Quickshell's popup
    // semantics can close this out from under the QML-driven `visible`
    // binding above for reasons outside this file's control - e.g. losing
    // its own focus grab, see grabFocus below) - keeps SettingsState.visible
    // in sync with reality whenever that happens, since without this, a
    // stray close leaves it stuck reading `true` while the real window is
    // actually gone, and clicking the gear again does nothing (setting an
    // already-true property to true again is a no-op, so `visible`'s own
    // binding never re-evaluates and the window never reopens). Reported
    // live as "appears for a second then disappears, clicking the icon
    // again doesn't do anything" - this is the fix for the second half;
    // see ControlCenter.qml's own gear button/Battery tile for the other

    onClosed: SettingsState.visible = false

    // Same override-redirect focus gap as Launcher.qml's taskbar-mode

    // confirmed live this affects Settings specifically, not just in
    // theory: without grabFocus, XGetInputFocus stays at PointerRoot
    // while this window is open, meaning keystrokes only reach it while
    // the mouse pointer happens to still be directly over it - the moment
    // the pointer drifts even slightly (trivially easy mid-typing in real
    // use), every further keystroke into any field here (icon paths,
    // display name, weather location) is silently lost. Reported live as
    // "it also does not let me type in those text boxes" - reproduced
    // exactly that way (typed text landing fine while the simulated
    // pointer stayed frozen over the field, then vanishing entirely the
    // instant the pointer moved away mid-edit, before any real fix).
    // Settings has real text entry throughout, unlike Tooltip.qml/
    // CalendarFlyout.qml, so this is unconditional here.

    // confirmed live in a Xephyr sandbox iteratively (each bump/trim
    // re-verified against a real screenshot, not calculated blind).
    // Reclaimed real space first rather than just growing the window -
    // six repeated two-line "applies immediately" descriptions collapsed
    // into one shared note above the group, the Screenshot folder row's
    // own description trimmed to one line, and the long icon/cursor/font
    // restart-note paragraph at the bottom reworded shorter without
    // losing any of its actual content - only grew implicitHeight once
    // those savings alone still weren't enough. 1040 is a few px past the
    // theoretical safe ceiling (974px: a bar-position-aware popup,
    // BarConfig.popupAnchorY, opening upward above a bottom-positioned
    // bar at its maximum configurable height - 96px, the default is 44px
    // - on a monitor exactly 1080px tall), accepted deliberately rather
    // than trimmed further - that specific combination is a narrow edge
    // case, and even then the overflow is small, not a severe breakage.
    // A shorter window that scrolled internally would have had more
    // slack to work with, but per explicit user preference this shows
    // everything statically instead; splitting a category further (like
    // Bar/Modules already were) is the intended fix if a future addition
    // ever makes one category's content taller than this.
