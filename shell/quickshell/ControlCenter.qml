// Phase 3 of the Noctalia-port effort (see ROADMAP.md): the "hidden tray"
// flyout, rebuilt as a single-column Control Center - header actions,
// quick-toggle grid, quick-launch actions, volume, kernel/network status,
// then a media card paired with a small cluster of circular system-stat
// gauges (CPU load, CPU/GPU temp, battery). Not a port of Noctalia v5's own
// Control Center (its code is Wayland/OpenGL-native, nothing to port),
// just the same idea built from Zaris's existing services: a richer, more
// scannable landing spot than one long column of label+widget rows.
// Deliberately skipped one piece of Noctalia's version that has no Zaris
// equivalent yet: weather+power-profile (no weather service or
// power-profile switching exists here - weather specifically is next up,
// per the user, not folded into this pass).
//
// Eighth pass: added the profile header (avatar, display name, uptime)
// this file's own comment used to list as intentionally skipped - "the
// bar's own clock is already visible behind this panel" reasoning applied
// to the clock specifically, not the profile block as a whole, and the
// user asked for the full header once the rest of the panel was in place.
// `HostService.qml` already had `displayName`/`username` from Phase 1
// (ported but never given a real use site until now) - only `uptimeText`
// is new there. No real `~/.face` exists on this machine, so the avatar
// falls back to a single-letter badge (`DockIcons.qml`'s existing
// fallback-avatar pattern, reused verbatim: `Colors.pill` circle + bold
// first-letter `NText`) - real-photo support (a `MultiEffect` circular
// mask, since Qt Quick's `Image` can't clip to a non-rectangular shape on
// its own) was verified separately with a throwaway test file, not left
// unverified just because this machine has nothing to show through it.
//
// Seventh pass: the media card is now a real "now playing" card (album art
// as a full-bleed background behind title/artist/album, a real seek
// scrubber via MediaService.seekByRatio(), bigger playback buttons) rather
// than a small thumbnail+text row, matching Noctalia's reference Control
// Center screenshot (not just its bar, which is all earlier passes had to
// go on). The old single master-volume row is now a real audio section -
// separate Output and Input columns, each with its own mute button,
// elided device `description` (Quickshell's Pipewire `PwNode`, confirmed
// via its qmltypes - `name`/`description`/`nickname` all exist, `description`
// reads closest to Noctalia's own verbose device names), and volume
// slider - `Pipewire.defaultAudioSource` (the input/mic device) is newly
// tracked alongside the existing `defaultAudioSink`.
//
// Third pass: dropped the Home/System tab split from the second pass -
// the user asked for the "System" section folded back into the main view
// after seeing Noctalia's own reference screenshot has no tabs at all,
// just one continuous column. Kernel/Network moved up into the main flow
// as plain rows; CPU load, CPU temp, GPU temp, and Battery became
// NCircularGauge dials (matching the small circular readouts clustered
// next to Noctalia's own media card) instead of separate label+row lines.
//
// Second pass: Settings, the power menu, and a close button moved here
// from being bare always-visible Bar.qml icons (a fixed header, visible
// at the top of the column); Clipboard, Wallpaper, and Screenshot got a
// quick-launch icon row (opening the same existing panels/script their old
// bar icons did). Clipboard/Wallpaper/Battery/Dnd's `modules.json` `tray`
// default flipped to `true` at the same time (ModulesConfig.qml), so they
// stop appearing inline in the bar automatically - no Bar.qml changes
// needed for those four, the existing tray mechanism already covers it.
//
// Same "tray": true opt-in from modules.json still gates every module here,
// exactly as it did in the old flat Overflow.qml - this is a presentation
// change, not a new config surface. Live state (StayAwake, NightLight, Dnd,
// Bluetooth, volume, media) is read from the same shared singletons/
// services the bar's inline modules use, so toggling from here stays in
// sync with the bar.
// Built on PopupWindow rather than a FloatingWindow, same reasoning as
// Settings.qml/CalendarFlyout.qml: anchors directly to the bar's own
// full-width background surface (ControlCenterState.barItem, set by
// whichever monitor's launcher icon was actually clicked) via `anchor.item`
// rather than a WM-side `topright 14 48` windowrule fixed to one screen
// corner - the WM rule looked fine while the bar only ever lived at the
// top, but once BarConfig.position could also be "bottom" (see BarConfig's
// own comment), a fixed top-right corner would leave Control Center
// visually disconnected from a bar that's actually at the bottom of the
// screen. Right-aligned under the bar (anchor.rect.x) and opening
// above/below it depending on BarConfig.position (BarConfig.popupAnchorY,
// shared with every other bar-anchored popup) keeps it attached to the bar
// wherever the bar actually is.

    // Fixed size, same reasoning as Settings.qml's fixed 680x460 - a real
    // bug found while building the second pass (not just a Xephyr-sandbox
    // artifact, confirmed via a debug Timer on the LIVE desktop with a
    // real WM running): FloatingWindow's actual OS-level height never
    // tracked content.implicitHeight growing after first map (this window
    // was a FloatingWindow at the time; PopupWindow has never been
    // observed to have this problem, but the fixed size is kept regardless
    // since nothing about this panel's content actually needs to grow).
    // Sidestepped the same way Settings.qml already does for its own
    // differently-sized categories - one fixed size generous enough for
    // the tallest state this panel can be in (every optional row/dial
    // visible at once). Widened a bit and given real side padding (the
    // content column stays at its existing contentWidth, just with more
    // breathing room on either side of it now) plus a subtle outer border
    // - a cleaner match for Noctalia's own reference screenshot, which has
    // visible padding and a bit of background definition around its
    // Control Center rather than content running edge-to-edge.

    // above reclaimed ~40px for it, so bumped further to 875 for real
    // breathing room. Still deliberately not the 900 the old Calendar
    // experiment needed (see below) - this grows *down* from the bar's
    // own fixed top anchor for a top-positioned bar (`BarConfig.
    // popupAnchorY`'s "top" branch returns a fixed offset off the bar
    // itself, independent of implicitHeight, unlike its "bottom" branch)
    // per an explicit request to grow the panel from the bottom
    // specifically, not shift its top edge. A Calendar section was
    // briefly added below the gauges cluster (which needed bumping this to
    // 900 plus wrapping everything in a scrolling NScrollView so the taller
    // content wouldn't clip past a 1080px-tall monitor's usable height) but
    // the user reconsidered - Control Center should never require
    // scrolling, full stop - so the Calendar section was pulled back out
    // (it stays in CalendarFlyout.qml, under the bar's clock) rather than
    // solved with a scrollbar.
