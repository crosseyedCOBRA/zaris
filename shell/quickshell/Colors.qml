// Shared palette so every part of the shell (bar, launcher, OSD, flyout,
// settings window) looks like one consistent thing rather than several.
// ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc and ~/.config/rofi/theme.rasi are themed to match
// these same values by hand -- they can't import this file, so keep them in
// sync manually if you change a color here.
//
// bg/text/blue/teal/coral are now sourced from ThemeConfig.qml (backed by
// ~/.config/quickshell/colors.json, editable via Settings' Colors tab or by
// hand) instead of being hardcoded - every file below and throughout the
// rest of the shell already references these exact names, so a theme
// change (or a built-in preset) propagates everywhere automatically with
// no other file needing to change. pill/pillActive/textMuted/purple/red
// stay fixed, deliberately out of scope for now (structural surface tones
// and the error/danger red, not part of the "4-5 custom colors" the
// theming system covers) - see ROADMAP.md's "per-module color overrides"
// backlog item for a possible future extension.

    // Material Design 3 role aliases, adapted from Noctalia's Color.qml (MIT
    // licensed, github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia @ v4.7.7 - see README.md's
    // "Third-party code" section) so ported Noctalia widgets that reference
    // `Color.mPrimary` etc. have something to bind to, without dragging in
    // their dynamic wallpaper-based color generation or live theme-switch
    // transition animations (Zaris's palette is a fixed set of constants,
    // never reassigned at runtime, so there's nothing to animate between).
    // Existing files keep using the flat names above directly - these are
    // purely additive, mapped onto them rather than replacing them:
    //   mPrimary/mSecondary/mTertiary - the three accent colors already in
    //     rotation across bar widgets (blue is the most-repeated accent, so
    //     it gets "primary"; teal and coral fill secondary/tertiary)
    //   mError - genuinely new; nothing above was a real alarm/danger red
    //     (coral reads more salmon than alarm), so `red` is a new base color
    //   mSurface/mSurfaceVariant - the two background tones already used
    //     for panels (bg) and cards/pills (pill)
    //   mOutline - textMuted, already used as the border color everywhere
    //   mHover - pillActive, already used for hover/active highlight fills
    //   mOn* - text or textMuted, whichever already reads correctly against
    //     that surface in the existing UI
