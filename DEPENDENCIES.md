# Dependencies

Exact package names for building and running ZarisWM, per package manager.
This is a living document — as the WM or shell gains/drops a dependency,
this needs updating alongside it.

**Status**: All three of Arch/pacman, Debian/apt, and Fedora/dnf now have
package names filled in below, and all three have had the real test: a
from-scratch `cmake` configure + build against exactly the listed
package set, confirmed clean on Artix, on a Devuan Excalibur VM (for
Debian/apt), and now on a real Fedora Linux 44 VM too (unattended
`virt-install` + kickstart, `dnf install` the exact list below, `cmake`
configure, build — all clean, no gaps). See
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)'s dependency-list beta blocker for the full
writeup.

## Build dependencies

What `cmake` needs to configure and build the `zaris` binary itself —
see `CMakeLists.txt`'s `pkg_check_modules` call, plus `xcb`/`xcb-shape`,
which it links directly without a pkg-config check for either.

| Needed for | pkg-config module(s) | Arch/pacman | Debian/apt | Fedora/dnf |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C++17 compiler | — | `gcc` | `g++` (or `build-essential`) | `gcc-c++` |
| Build system | — | `cmake` | `cmake` | `cmake` |
| `pkg-config` itself | — | `pkgconf` | `pkg-config` | `pkgconf-pkg-config` |
| glib | `glib-2.0` | `glib2` | `libglib2.0-dev` | `glib2-devel` |
| Core XCB + RandR/Xinerama/Shape | `xcb`, `xcb-randr`, `xcb-xinerama`, `xcb-shape` | `libxcb` (covers all four) | `libxcb1-dev`, `libxcb-randr0-dev`, `libxcb-xinerama0-dev`, `libxcb-shape0-dev` (split up) | `libxcb-devel` (covers all four, same as Arch) |
| XCB utility helpers | `xcb-util` | `xcb-util` | `libxcb-util-dev` | `xcb-util-devel` |
| EWMH/ICCCM window-manager helpers | `xcb-ewmh`, `xcb-icccm` | `xcb-util-wm` (covers both) | `libxcb-ewmh-dev`, `libxcb-icccm4-dev` (split up) | `xcb-util-wm-devel` (covers both, same as Arch) |
| Keysym helpers | `xcb-keysyms` | `xcb-util-keysyms` | `libxcb-keysyms1-dev` | `xcb-util-keysyms-devel` |
| Cursor helpers | `xcb-cursor` | `xcb-util-cursor` | `libxcb-cursor-dev` | `xcb-util-cursor-devel` |

```sh
# Arch — verified by an actual clean configure + build against exactly this set
sudo pacman -S --needed gcc cmake pkgconf glib2 libxcb xcb-util xcb-util-wm xcb-util-keysyms xcb-util-cursor

# Debian/apt — verified by an actual clean configure + build against exactly this set, on a real Devuan Excalibur VM
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config git \
  libglib2.0-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-ewmh-dev \
  libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev \
  libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-shape0-dev

# Fedora/dnf — verified by an actual clean configure + build against exactly this set, on a real Fedora Linux 44 VM
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake pkgconf-pkg-config git \
  glib2-devel libxcb-devel xcb-util-devel xcb-util-wm-devel \
  xcb-util-keysyms-devel xcb-util-cursor-devel
```

The general pattern: Arch and Fedora both bundle several XCB
extensions/helpers into one package (`libxcb`/`libxcb-devel`,
`xcb-util-wm`/`xcb-util-wm-devel`) — they happen to split along the same
lines as each other. Debian is the odd one out, shipping one `-dev`
package per pkg-config module. Worth remembering for anything new added
later — a single new Arch/Fedora dependency may turn into several
Debian ones.

## Shell runtime dependencies

What `shell/` (the Quickshell bar/launcher/OSD/lock, see
[shell/README.md](shell/README.md)) needs at runtime, beyond the WM
itself.

| Purpose | Arch/pacman | Debian/apt | Fedora/dnf |
|---|---|---|---|
| The shell runtime itself | `quickshell` (official, `extra`) | **Not packaged**, but buildable from source with apt-only deps — see "Building Quickshell from source" below | `quickshell` — official, but currently a git-snapshot build (`0.2.1^git...`), not a tagged release; worth a version sanity-check before relying on it |
| Compositor (real alpha blending, rounded-corner AA, shadows, blur) | `picom` | `picom` | `picom` — official on all three; Zaris itself does no compositing (see ROADMAP.md), `zaris.conf` execs it with `shell/zaris/picom.conf` |
| Bar's Workspaces module (workspace pills, click to switch) | `wmctrl` | `wmctrl` | `wmctrl` — same package name on all three (unverified on Debian/Fedora beyond checking it's a real package there — not run through the same from-scratch-VM verification the rest of this table has); `Workspaces.qml` calls it directly (`wmctrl -d`/`wmctrl -s`), no fallback - missing it means the pills just silently render as an empty row |
| Audio stack + `wpctl` for the volume OSD | `pipewire`, `pipewire-pulse`, `wireplumber` | `pipewire`, `pipewire-pulse`, `wireplumber` | `pipewire`, `pipewire-pulseaudio` (different name — no `-pulse` suffix), `wireplumber` |
| Notification daemon | `dunst` | `dunst` | `dunst` |
| Power menu's picker | `rofi` | `rofi` | `rofi` |
| Screenshots (+ clipboard copy) | `maim`, `xclip` | `maim`, `xclip` | `maim`, `xclip` |
| Idle-based screen lock timer | `xss-lock` | `xss-lock` | `xss-lock` |
| Screen locker | `i3lock` | `i3lock` | `i3lock` |
| Wallpaper image | `xwallpaper` | `xwallpaper` | `xwallpaper` — same package name on all three (unverified on Debian/Fedora beyond checking it's a real package there, same caveat as `wmctrl` above); `zaris.conf`'s default `exec-once` now uses it directly (`--zoom`). `xorg-xsetroot`/`x11-xserver-utils`/`xorg-x11-server-utils` (all provide `xsetroot`) is the alternative if you'd rather have a plain solid color than an image |
| Bar icon glyphs (Nerd Font) | `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd` (official, `extra`) | Not packaged, but installed the same way as Fedora — see "Installing the Nerd Font from upstream" below | Not packaged either — same upstream-download install as Debian |
| Notification icon theme | `papirus-icon-theme` | `papirus-icon-theme` | `papirus-icon-theme` — official |
| `loginctl` for the power menu | `elogind` (Arch is systemd-default, so not actually needed there — only relevant on a non-systemd Arch-based system like Artix) | `elogind`, `libpam-elogind` | Not needed — Fedora only ships systemd, `loginctl` is native |
| Night light color-temperature toggle | `redshift` | `redshift` | `redshift` — confirmed official on all three (checked live via sources.debian.org and packages.fedoraproject.org) |
| Bluetooth applet (daemon) | `bluez` | `bluez` | `bluez` |
| Bluetooth applet (service enablement) | `bluez-openrc` (only needed on a non-systemd Arch-based system like Artix — `bluetoothd` has no OpenRC script of its own otherwise; `rc-update add bluetoothd default && rc-service bluetoothd start`) | Not needed — `bluez`'s own systemd unit (`bluetooth.service`) is enabled automatically | Not needed — same as Debian, systemd-native |
| Clipboard manager (change detection) | `clipnotify` | **Not packaged** — confirmed absent from packages.debian.org/sources.debian.org; being a tiny X11+Xfixes-only C program, building from source is the likely fix (not yet done, see ROADMAP.md) | `clipnotify` — confirmed via packages.fedoraproject.org |
| Battery status bar module | `upower` | `upower` | `upower` — official on all three; needs the `upowerd` daemon actually running (confirmed active on the Arch reference machine via `busctl list`), most full desktop environments start this automatically but a minimal X11-only install might need `rc-update add upower default`/equivalent |
| Network status/toggle bar modules + the Network flyout (`nmcli`) | `networkmanager` | `network-manager` | `NetworkManager` — package names as commonly packaged on each distro; only the Arch one is actually confirmed running on this project's own reference machine (`nmcli`'s own output used throughout `NetworkToggle.qml`/`WifiToggle.qml`/`NetworkInterfacesService.qml`/`VpnToggle.qml`/`WifiNetworksService.qml`/`NetworkPanel.qml`) - this whole row was a pre-existing gap in this table (`nmcli` had been a real dependency since the very first VPN-toggle pass, just never logged here), not something the Network flyout introduced alone; the Debian/Fedora names aren't separately VM-verified the way `wmctrl`/`xwallpaper`/`xcolor` above are flagged as being. Needs `NetworkManager.service` actually running and actively managing the machine's interfaces (confirmed on the reference machine) - a system using a different network stack (plain `systemd-networkd`, `dhcpcd`, etc.) would need to switch to NetworkManager for any of these modules to have anything to report. |

The Arch-side data is what's actually installed and running on this
project's own Artix reference machine. The Debian-side and Fedora-side
data are both confirmed against real package metadata (a live Devuan
Excalibur VM for Debian, packages.fedoraproject.org listings for
Fedora), not guessed.

## Optional dependencies (feature-gated, not required for the shell to run)

Some in-progress `shell/` features are designed to degrade gracefully
when their backing tool isn't installed (module hides itself / reports
"not available" rather than erroring), so these are opt-in installs for
whoever wants the specific feature, not core runtime deps like the table
above.

| Feature | Needs | Arch/pacman | Debian/apt | Fedora/dnf | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brightness control — external monitors (DDC/CI) | `ddcutil` | `ddcutil` | `ddcutil` | `ddcutil` | **Installed and confirmed working end-to-end** against three real DDC/CI monitors — `qs ipc call brightness increase/decrease` genuinely changes hardware brightness now, keybinds uncommented in the live `zaris.conf`. Installing it surfaced a real X11-vs-DRM connector-naming bug in `BrightnessService.qml` (now fixed) — see ROADMAP.md for the full story. |
| Brightness control — internal laptop backlight | `brightnessctl` | `brightnessctl` | `brightnessctl` | `brightnessctl` | Installed, but this machine has no `/sys/class/backlight` device to control (desktop, not a laptop) — still only degrade-gracefully verified, not end-to-end. Needs real laptop hardware to test further. |
| Audio visualizer bar module | `pipewire-pulse` (already a core runtime dep, provides `parec`) + `python3` | `pipewire-pulse` + `python3` | `pipewire-pulse` + `python3` (unverified on Debian/Fedora beyond checking both are real packages there — not run through this table's from-scratch-VM verification) | Off by default (`AudioVisualizer.qml`, real continuous CPU cost while enabled - see `ROADMAP.md`). `python3` is the one genuinely new dependency here; `parec` was already required. Confirmed working end-to-end: the RMS pipeline (`shell/zaris/audio-levels.sh`) tested directly against both silence and real playback with clearly elevated values, and the rendered bar confirmed live before the machine moved to other active use. |
| Color picker bar module | `xcolor` | `xcolor` (official `extra`) | `xcolor` (unverified on Debian/Fedora beyond checking it's a real package there — not run through this table's from-scratch-VM verification) | Off by default (`ColorPicker.qml`). Confirmed working end-to-end on this machine: click the bar icon, click anywhere on screen, real sampled hex color copied to the clipboard, confirmed via a live screenshot and a direct clipboard read. Not separately verified that the module degrades gracefully with `xcolor` uninstalled (untested absence, unlike the other rows here) — the underlying `Process` call should just silently fail to launch rather than crash, matching every other CLI-wrapping module's behavior, but that's an assumption from the pattern, not a confirmed test. |
| Power profile switching (Control Center) | `power-profiles-daemon` (Arch also has a dedicated `-openrc` init-script package, matching this project's OpenRC-based setup) | `power-profiles-daemon` | `power-profiles-daemon` | `power-profiles-daemon` | **Not installed on this machine** — built ahead of it per this project's own established practice (see ROADMAP.md). Confirmed only that the feature degrades gracefully without it (no crash, no false-active profile shown, `Process` simply never fires when `powerprofilesctl` doesn't exist). Needs the daemon actually installed and enabled to verify the real toggle end-to-end. |

## Building Quickshell from source (Debian only)

`quickshell` isn't packaged for Debian at all, but it builds cleanly
from the upstream mirror with only apt-available dependencies — verified
end-to-end on a real Devuan Excalibur VM (configure, build, install, and
`qs --version` all confirmed working). This is what
`contrib/devuan-bootstrap.sh`'s `quickshell` step automates.

```sh
sudo apt-get install ninja-build qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev \
  qt6-declarative-dev-tools qt6-declarative-private-dev \
  qt6-shadertools-dev libdrm-dev spirv-tools libcli11-dev \
  libpipewire-0.3-dev

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/quickshell-mirror/quickshell.git
cmake -GNinja -S quickshell -B quickshell/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DWAYLAND=OFF -DWAYLAND_WLR_LAYERSHELL=OFF -DWAYLAND_SESSION_LOCK=OFF \
  -DWAYLAND_TOPLEVEL_MANAGEMENT=OFF -DSCREENCOPY=OFF -DHYPRLAND=OFF -DI3=OFF \
  -DCRASH_HANDLER=OFF -DUSE_JEMALLOC=OFF -DSERVICE_PAM=OFF -DSERVICE_POLKIT=OFF \
  -DX11=ON -DSOCKETS=ON -DSERVICE_PIPEWIRE=ON -DSERVICE_STATUS_NOTIFIER=ON \
  -DSERVICE_MPRIS=ON
cmake --build quickshell/build
sudo cmake --install quickshell/build
```

The Wayland-specific flags (`WAYLAND*`, `SCREENCOPY`) and the unrelated
`HYPRLAND`/`I3` IPC integrations are turned off since Zaris is X11-only
and neither Hyprland nor i3 apply here — this trims the dependency list
and avoids needing Qt6 Wayland's private headers on top of QtDeclarative's
(Debian trixie ships Qt 6.8, and Quickshell's `BUILD.md` notes private
headers are required for both below Qt 6.10). `CRASH_HANDLER` (needs
`cpptrace`, unpackaged on Debian) and `USE_JEMALLOC` are off since neither
is required for the shell to function. Quickshell's own CMake install
rules create the `qs` symlink to `quickshell` automatically — confirmed
present and working after `cmake --install`, no manual symlink needed.

## Installing the Nerd Font from upstream (Debian and Fedora)

Neither Debian nor Fedora has an official *patched* Nerd Font package
(Arch is the outlier here — `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd` is official,
`extra`). Rather than reach for a COPR on Fedora and Nix on Debian —
two different answers for the same problem — the upstream Nerd Fonts
project publishes ready-to-use per-font archives on GitHub releases,
which installs identically on any distro with no package manager
involved at all. Verified end-to-end on the Devuan VM: extracted,
`fc-cache`'d, and `fc-match 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font:style=SemiBold'`
resolved correctly — the exact family+style string
`shell/dunst/dunstrc` uses. This is what `contrib/devuan-bootstrap.sh`'s
`nerdfont` step automates.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/JetBrainsMonoNerdFont
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/JetBrainsMono.tar.xz \
  | tar -xJ -C ~/.local/share/fonts/JetBrainsMonoNerdFont
fc-cache -f ~/.local/share/fonts
```

## Uniform across all three

After the work above, every build dependency, every shell runtime
dependency, `quickshell` itself (via the from-source build), and the
Nerd Font (via the upstream download) are all confirmed working
identically on Arch, Debian, and Fedora. No genuinely non-uniform gaps
remain open at this point.

## Resolved gaps (for reference)

**Screen locker: resolved.** Originally `betterlockscreen`/`i3lock-color`
on Arch, neither of which exist in Debian's repos at all (and are
AUR-only even on Arch). Swapped to plain `i3lock` instead, confirmed as
an official package on Arch, Debian, *and* Fedora alike (the only locker
that clears all three) — one dependency, uniform across every target
distro, no per-distro branching needed. The tradeoff: `i3lock` has no
built-in blur/theming, so the previous blurred-wallpaper look is gone
for now. `zaris.conf`'s idle-lock comment block has the note for anyone
who wants to add that back later — it'd need a small vendored script
(screenshot via `scrot`/`import`, blur via `imagemagick`, then hand off
to `i3lock`), since no distro packages that combination as one thing.

**Idle-lock timer: resolved.** Originally `xautolock`, which isn't
packaged for Debian under any name (confirmed via `apt-cache search`) and
looks AUR-only on stock Arch too (only official via Artix's own `galaxy`
repo). Swapped to `xss-lock`, confirmed official on Arch, Debian, *and*
Fedora — same uniformity win as the locker swap above. Real mechanism
difference worth knowing: `xss-lock` has no `-time` flag of its own, it
fires off the X screensaver extension's own activation event instead, so
the idle timeout now lives in the X server's screensaver timer (`xset q`)
rather than a dedicated option — verified end-to-end in a Xephyr sandbox
that `xss-lock -- i3lock` correctly spawns `i3lock` on that event.
`xss-lock` also listens for logind's Lock signal (elogind reimplements
this, already a shell dependency for the power menu's `loginctl` calls),
so a suspend/lid event or manual `loginctl lock-session` locks too, not
just idle timeout — a capability `xautolock` never had. One knock-on
simplification: the "stay awake" toggle's `xset s off` already fully
suppresses screensaver activation (and therefore `xss-lock`, which can't
fire without that event) on its own, so the separate `xautolock -enable`/
`-disable` IPC call this project's earlier setup needed is gone —
confirmed via `xset q` showing `timeout: 0` after `s off`, though the
actual auto-fire-vs-suppressed timing comparison didn't reproduce
cleanly under Xephyr (nested X servers are known to be unreliable about
real idle-timer counting), so that specific piece rests on X11's
well-established core-protocol semantics for `timeout: 0` rather than a
clean sandboxed reproduction.

**`quickshell` itself: resolved.** Not packaged for Debian at all;
resolved by building from source with apt-only deps (Qt6 dev packages,
libdrm, spirv-tools, cli11, pipewire dev), Wayland/Hyprland/i3 features
turned off since Zaris is X11-only — see "Building Quickshell from
source" above for the full recipe and what got verified.

**Nerd Font: resolved.** Not packaged for either Debian or Fedora;
resolved by downloading the patched font directly from the upstream
Nerd Fonts project's GitHub releases rather than reaching for a
per-distro third-party source (Nix, a COPR) — see "Installing the Nerd
Font from upstream" above. Same recipe works on Arch too, if you'd
rather skip the official package there for consistency's sake, though
there's no real need to since it's already official there.
